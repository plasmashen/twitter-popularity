I've been saying I was going to do a response video for a long time now, but with The Shape of Water set for release next week, it's definitely time to address some of those comments.\\n\\n📺 33 Things You Missed In The Shape of Water Trailer: https://youtu.be/3wt9mMg5GJQ\\n\\nPreviously, I covered some things you missed, but in this analysis, I'll talk about what I missed, my favorite fan theories from the comments and debunk some of the mysteries that we debated in the last video, such as the possible Abe Sapien relationship, plagiarism allegations relating to the movie's similarities to The Space Between Us, connections to HP Lovecraft's The Deep Ones and much, much more. \\n\\nAnd yes... I'm sick and my voice sounds terrible, but please bear with me.

Subscribe to our channel: http://goo.gl/ho3Hg6\\n\\n“If at first you don’t succeed, try and try again.”\\nUnfortunately, when it comes to Hollywood sometimes that gets taken a little too literally. Some movies are better left alone, but it seems that rather than hiring writers to come up with fresh ideas, producers are intent on making the same movies over, and over, and over again. Whether they are beloved classics that are perfect as is, or a critical and box office flop getting a second shot at success, you can’t enter a theatre these days without seeing a handful of rebooted favorites lining the marquee.\\n\\nFrom Green Lantern with a new star and updated concept, to Ace Ventura with or without Jim Carrey, a Clint Eastwood classic that will hopefully still co-star a chimpanzee, Alfred Hitchcock’s The Birds updated for television, The Sword in the Stone made live action and given some Game of Thrones flare, A Rambo update with a Bollywood twist, Charlie’s Angels with an edgy new cast, Tim Burton’s long talked-about Dumbo revamp, the third installment of The Blob with Samuel L. Jackson (I’m tired of this m—- f—-ing blob on this m— f—ing… earth?), and an all female re-imagining of the classic Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, there’s a remake for everyone, whether or not they asked for it. \\n\\nThere are remakes of originals, remakes of remakes, remakes of remakes of television shows, and remakes of books being remade into television. If you can make it and make it again, Hollywood has got you covered. \\n\\nCheck Out These Other Amazing Videos:\\n\\n10 Superheroes Marvel COMPLETELY Changed For Their Movies\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bZyt4lGEXo\\n\\n10 Popular Movies RUINED By Last Minute Changes\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khe_iyjQTes\\n\\nFeaturing: \\n\\nGreen Lantern Corps \\nAce Ventura\\nAny Which Way But Loose\\nThe Birds \\nThe Sword in the Stone\\nRambo\\nCharlie’s Angels\\nDumbo \\nThe Blob\\nThe Hustle\\n\\nOur Social Media:\\nhttps://twitter.com/screenrant\\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ScreenRant\\nhttps://plus.google.com/+ScreenRant\\n\\nOur Website\\nhttp://screenrant.com/</td>\n",

A huge role on a huge show, plus her prominent relationship with musician Josh Groban, kept Dennings on the pop culture radar for years. But then, she just kind of disappeared.

       "14    The title of this year’s Best Picture winner, “The Shape of Water,” gives away the game, for the one thing that water does not have is shape. Its very essence is fluidity, formlessness, and freedom from structure. But a film that celebrates this freedom—produced by someone who, by his own admission, hates structure—is sadly emblematic, I fear, of a society that is in danger of losing its ontological balance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

       "26    A closer look at some of the things you may have missed in Guillermo Del Toro's The Shape of Water (2017).\\n► Merch Store Link: https://goo.gl/CKWpoB\\n\\nI have speculated for months about what may be in store for us with The Shape of Water, ever since a Things You Missed I did on the trailer back in July. This weekend, the film is finally released, so I'll be dissecting commonly overlooked details, Easter Eggs, connections to Creature From The Black Lagoon and more. \\n\\nThis time I'm bringing you a whopping 55 new facts about this unique monster movie. I'll dive into topics like the symbolism of time, the meaning and use of color, recurring themes and even deciphering those strange hieroglyphics on the couch. \\n\\nI'll also break down the ending and give my own theory on how it went down and what the amphibian creature actually was. Join me as we go deeper into this movie than ever before.\\n\\nI'm also doing a free CZsWorld merch giveaway to one lucky fan, stay tuned for the details on that.\\n\\n#theshapeofwater\\n\\nOfficial Contest Rules: Free to enter.

       "1500  How many more remakes are Hollywood going to pump out this year? Subscribe to our channel: http://goo.gl/ho3Hg6\\n\\n“If at first you don’t succeed, try and try again.”\\nUnfortunately, when it comes to Hollywood sometimes that gets taken a little too literally. Some movies are better left alone, but it seems that rather than hiring writers to come up with fresh ideas, producers are intent on making the same movies over, and over, and over again. Whether they are beloved classics that are perfect as is, or a critical and box office flop getting a second shot at success, you can’t enter a theatre these days without seeing a handful of rebooted favorites lining the marquee.\\n\\nFrom Green Lantern with a new star and updated concept, to Ace Ventura with or without Jim Carrey, a Clint Eastwood classic that will hopefully still co-star a chimpanzee, Alfred Hitchcock’s The Birds updated for television, The Sword in the Stone made live action and given some Game of Thrones flare, A Rambo update with a Bollywood twist, Charlie’s Angels with an edgy new cast, Tim Burton’s long talked-about Dumbo revamp, the third installment of The Blob with Samuel L. Jackson (I’m tired of this m—- f—-ing blob on this m— f—ing… earth?), and an all female re-imagining of the classic Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, there’s a remake for everyone, whether or not they asked for it. \\n\\nThere are remakes of originals, remakes of remakes, remakes of remakes of television shows, and remakes of books being remade into television. If you can make it and make it again, Hollywood has got you covered. \\n\\nCheck Out These Other Amazing Videos:\\n\\n10 Superheroes Marvel COMPLETELY Changed For Their Movies\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bZyt4lGEXo\\n\\n10 Popular Movies RUINED By Last Minute Changes\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khe_iyjQTes\\n\\nFeaturing: \\n\\nGreen Lantern Corps \\nAce Ventura\\nAny Which Way But Loose\\nThe Birds \\nThe Sword in the Stone\\nRambo\\nCharlie’s Angels\\nDumbo \\nThe Blob\\nThe Hustle\\n\\nOur Social Media:\\nhttps://twitter.com/screenrant\\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ScreenRant\\nhttps://plus.google.com/+ScreenRant\\n\\nOur Website\\nhttp://screenrant.com/                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

       "1503  If you're new, Subscribe! → http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Nicki-Swift\\n\\nActress Kat Dennings has charmed audiences on the small and big screen since she was a teen, but she's best known for her six-year run in a role that perfectly suited her comic gifts and big personality: Max Black, the sarcastic and wisecracking diner waitress and cupcake baker on CBS' 2 Broke Girls. A huge role on a huge show, plus her prominent relationship with musician Josh Groban, kept Dennings on the pop culture radar for years. But then, she just kind of disappeared. It feels like Hollywood won't cast Dennings anymore.

I'm sick and my voice sounds terrible, but please bear with me.

I'll dive into topics like the symbolism of time, the meaning and use of color, recurring themes and even deciphering those strange hieroglyphics on the couch. \\n\\nI'll also break down the ending and give my own theory on how it went down and what the amphibian creature actually was. Join me as we go deeper into this movie than ever before.\\n\\nI'm also doing a free CZsWorld merch giveaway to one lucky fan, stay tuned for the details on that.\\n\\n#theshapeofwater\\n\\nOfficial Contest Rules: Free to enter.

Subscribe to our channel: http://goo.gl/ho3Hg6\\n\\n“If at first you don’t succeed, try and try again.”\\nUnfortunately, when it comes to Hollywood sometimes that gets taken a little too literally. Some movies are better left alone, but it seems that rather than hiring writers to come up with fresh ideas, producers are intent on making the same movies over, and over, and over again. Whether they are beloved classics that are perfect as is, or a critical and box office flop getting a second shot at success, you can’t enter a theatre these days without seeing a handful of rebooted favorites lining the marquee.\\n\\nFrom Green Lantern with a new star and updated concept, to Ace Ventura with or without Jim Carrey, a Clint Eastwood classic that will hopefully still co-star a chimpanzee, Alfred Hitchcock’s The Birds updated for television, The Sword in the Stone made live action and given some Game of Thrones flare, A Rambo update with a Bollywood twist, Charlie’s Angels with an edgy new cast, Tim Burton’s long talked-about Dumbo revamp, the third installment of The Blob with Samuel L. Jackson (I’m tired of this m—- f—-ing blob on this m— f—ing… earth?), and an all female re-imagining of the classic Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, there’s a remake for everyone, whether or not they asked for it. \\n\\nThere are remakes of originals, remakes of remakes, remakes of remakes of television shows, and remakes of books being remade into television. If you can make it and make it again, Hollywood has got you covered. \\n\\nCheck Out These Other Amazing Videos:\\n\\n10 Superheroes Marvel COMPLETELY Changed For Their Movies\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bZyt4lGEXo\\n\\n10 Popular Movies RUINED By Last Minute Changes\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khe_iyjQTes\\n\\nFeaturing: \\n\\nGreen Lantern Corps \\nAce Ventura\\nAny Which Way But Loose\\nThe Birds \\nThe Sword in the Stone\\nRambo\\nCharlie’s Angels\\nDumbo \\nThe Blob\\nThe Hustle\\n\\nOur Social Media:\\nhttps://twitter.com/screenrant\\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ScreenRant\\nhttps://plus.google.com/+ScreenRant\\n\\nOur Website\\nhttp://screenrant.com/</td>\n",

A huge role on a huge show, plus her prominent relationship with musician Josh Groban, kept Dennings on the pop culture radar for years. But then, she just kind of disappeared.

       "14    The title of this year’s Best Picture winner, “The Shape of Water,” gives away the game, for the one thing that water does not have is shape. Its very essence is fluidity, formlessness, and freedom from structure. But a film that celebrates this freedom—produced by someone who, by his own admission, hates structure—is sadly emblematic, I fear, of a society that is in danger of losing its ontological balance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

       "26    A closer look at some of the things you may have missed in Guillermo Del Toro's The Shape of Water (2017).\\n? Merch Store Link: https://goo.gl/CKWpoB\\n\\nI have speculated for months about what may be in store for us with The Shape of Water, ever since a Things You Missed I did on the trailer back in July. This weekend, the film is finally released, so I'll be dissecting commonly overlooked details, Easter Eggs, connections to Creature From The Black Lagoon and more. \\n\\nThis time I'm bringing you a whopping 55 new facts about this unique monster movie. I'll dive into topics like the symbolism of time, the meaning and use of color, recurring themes and even deciphering those strange hieroglyphics on the couch. \\n\\nI'll also break down the ending and give my own theory on how it went down and what the amphibian creature actually was. Join me as we go deeper into this movie than ever before.\\n\\nI'm also doing a free CZsWorld merch giveaway to one lucky fan, stay tuned for the details on that.\\n\\n#theshapeofwater\\n\\nOfficial Contest Rules: Free to enter.

       "1500  How many more remakes are Hollywood going to pump out this year? Subscribe to our channel: http://goo.gl/ho3Hg6\\n\\n“If at first you don’t succeed, try and try again.”\\nUnfortunately, when it comes to Hollywood sometimes that gets taken a little too literally. Some movies are better left alone, but it seems that rather than hiring writers to come up with fresh ideas, producers are intent on making the same movies over, and over, and over again. Whether they are beloved classics that are perfect as is, or a critical and box office flop getting a second shot at success, you can’t enter a theatre these days without seeing a handful of rebooted favorites lining the marquee.\\n\\nFrom Green Lantern with a new star and updated concept, to Ace Ventura with or without Jim Carrey, a Clint Eastwood classic that will hopefully still co-star a chimpanzee, Alfred Hitchcock’s The Birds updated for television, The Sword in the Stone made live action and given some Game of Thrones flare, A Rambo update with a Bollywood twist, Charlie’s Angels with an edgy new cast, Tim Burton’s long talked-about Dumbo revamp, the third installment of The Blob with Samuel L. Jackson (I’m tired of this m—- f—-ing blob on this m— f—ing… earth?), and an all female re-imagining of the classic Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, there’s a remake for everyone, whether or not they asked for it. \\n\\nThere are remakes of originals, remakes of remakes, remakes of remakes of television shows, and remakes of books being remade into television. If you can make it and make it again, Hollywood has got you covered. \\n\\nCheck Out These Other Amazing Videos:\\n\\n10 Superheroes Marvel COMPLETELY Changed For Their Movies\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bZyt4lGEXo\\n\\n10 Popular Movies RUINED By Last Minute Changes\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khe_iyjQTes\\n\\nFeaturing: \\n\\nGreen Lantern Corps \\nAce Ventura\\nAny Which Way But Loose\\nThe Birds \\nThe Sword in the Stone\\nRambo\\nCharlie’s Angels\\nDumbo \\nThe Blob\\nThe Hustle\\n\\nOur Social Media:\\nhttps://twitter.com/screenrant\\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ScreenRant\\nhttps://plus.google.com/+ScreenRant\\n\\nOur Website\\nhttp://screenrant.com/                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

       "1503  If you're new, Subscribe! ? http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Nicki-Swift\\n\\nActress Kat Dennings has charmed audiences on the small and big screen since she was a teen, but she's best known for her six-year run in a role that perfectly suited her comic gifts and big personality: Max Black, the sarcastic and wisecracking diner waitress and cupcake baker on CBS' 2 Broke Girls. A huge role on a huge show, plus her prominent relationship with musician Josh Groban, kept Dennings on the pop culture radar for years. But then, she just kind of disappeared. It feels like Hollywood won't cast Dennings anymore.
